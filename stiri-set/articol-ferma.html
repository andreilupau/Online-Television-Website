      <p>
        Vasile first dreamed of running his own sheep farm at 15. The initial
        flock never reached the profit he imagined, so he sold part of it and
        left for Germany to work. Time abroad gave him both capital and a new
        perspective on structuring a modern, lean operation.
      </p>
      <h2>Restarting the project</h2>
      <p>
        After returning he formally registered a local company. Early decisions
        focused on dedicated land, reliable fencing, efficient water management
        and trimming labor overhead through standardized routines.
      </p>
      <h2>Investment and productive breeds</h2>
      <p>
        Total spending has climbed toward €150,000—covering infrastructure plus
        sheep and goat stock imported from Austria and other European sources
        for stronger genetics. These breeds deliver higher milk yield and
        quality suited for artisanal cheeses.
      </p>
      <h2>Year‑round milk technology</h2>
      <p>
        A core target: sustaining milk flow through winter. Adjusted breeding
        cycles and controlled housing protocols keep fresh curd on offer when
        the market is quieter.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        “You work, you invest—and if you stay consistent you can earn the money
        back in a year or two.”
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Operational challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Stable labor is hard to secure: herders, a butcher, retail staff. Feed
        costs run higher compared to nearby markets, squeezing margins.
      </p>
      <h2>Financing attempts</h2>
      <p>
        Grant and subsidy applications met bank refusals due to company size.
        Missed fiscal exemptions and unrefunded VAT added unplanned customs
        costs when importing animals.
      </p>
      <h2>Long‑term perspective</h2>
      <p>
        Next steps include a small facility for sheep and goat milk cheeses. A
        potential bottled goat milk line is still under review—demand remains
        unstable.
      </p>
      <h2>Advice for returnees</h2>
      <p>
        He stresses discipline and a clear investment plan: finish what you
        start, don’t hop between ideas. Cross‑border trade is far easier than
        decades ago, but internal organization and local genetic selection need
        improvement.
      </p>
      <h2>Future and adaptation</h2>
      <p>
        Fragmented labor and variable costs create friction, yet the family
        views expansion as incremental. External experience sharpened work
        standards; professionalization is ongoing.
